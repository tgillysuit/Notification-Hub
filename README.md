# The Gillypad Notification Hub

## This is a class assignment, turned personal project.

The goal of this project was to bring all the knowledge that we had learned in our Web Frameworks class.

I created a project that could take in user data and put that information into a database (MySQL WB + MariaDB) and post that information onto an Admin page.

I will continue to build onto this project as a personal project where eventually I can send out notifications to SMS text messages and emails for updates of the content that I've posted and created from my content creation social medias.
